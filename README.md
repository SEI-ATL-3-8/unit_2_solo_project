# Unit 2 Solo Projects

## Project Requirements
- Two repos in your own personal github, one containing your frontend and one containing your backend.
- A backend express server that persists data to a database
- At least 2 tables in your database
- A sequelize model for each of your database tables
- At least one association (1-t-m or m-t-m) among your sequelize models
- Routes that allow CRUD operations on your database tables
- User authentication flow (creating an account, logging in, logging out)
- A separate frontend express server that serves up html, css, and frontend js
- Deploy both the frontend and the backend using Heroku (there will be a deployment jam!)
- A `README.md` containing sections described below

## README requirements / pitch requirements
Your pitch is due Friday 4/9. Make two repos for this project in your own personal github, one for the frontend and one for the backend. Make a `README.md` in either one; this README will contain your pitch. Your README should contain:

1. Title of the project (biggest header in the document)
1. Overview: summarize the goals of your app, and describe the problem your app is built to solve.
1. Wireframes: explained below.
1. User stories: a series of statements in the form of "When I {do X}, {Y happens}." These statements should encompass the whole functionality of playing the game.
1. Routes inventory: list all the routes you plan to have in your backend. Include the http verb, the path, and a brief summary of what the route does. (To represent this nicely in markdown, you might want to look up how to make a table in a markdown file!)
1. MVP checklist: A list of all the functionalities that will constitute the bare minimum version of your game. Note that this list should be sized so that you can complete it by ~Monday, leaving Tuesday to tackle stretch goals.
1. Stretch goals: A list of awesome bonus goals you will work on after completing your MVP.

### Wireframes:
- Use a tool like https://awwapp.com/, https://www.mockflow.com/, or good ol zoom whiteboard to create wireframes for your project. Whatever you use, get a screen cap.
- Your wireframes should walk the reader through the screen states, and should include short descriptions of each screen. It's a good idea to give your wireframes labels (like 1, 2, 3 etc), and to indicate which screens transitions to which other screens.
- Move your image files into the project folder and link them in your README. (You might want to put all your wireframe images into a single folder called images or assets. In that case you'll have to specify the filepath to those images including the containing folder.) Pro tip: use VScode's markdown previewer!
